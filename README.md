# Automating-User-Login-processes-for-SDLMS-Application
Testing Approach Document: SDLMS Login Process

Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for evaluating the login and user authentication process within the Software Development Learning Management System (SDLMS). The primary goal is to ensure the reliability and functionality of the login feature in SDLMS application.

Test Cases

Test Case 1: Successful Login with Valid Credentials

Objective: Verify that users can successfully access the SDLMS by providing valid login credentials.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Open the SDLMS application.

2.Enter a valid username and password.

3.Click the "Login" button.

Expected Outcome: The user should be redirected to the dashboard screen.


Test Case 2: Handling Unsuccessful Login Attempts with Invalid Credentials

Objective: Confirm that the SDLMS handles invalid login attempts correctly and provides appropriate feedback.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Open the SDLMS application.

2.Enter invalid username and password combinations.

3.Click the "Login" button.

Expected Outcome: The user should remain on the login page, and an error message should be displayed.


Test Case 3: Validation of Error Messages for Invalid Login Attempts

Objective: Ensure that the SDLMS displays clear and relevant error messages when login attempts fail.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Open the SDLMS application.

2.Enter invalid username and password.

3.Click the "Login" button.

Expected Outcome: An error message corresponding to the specific login failure reason should be visible.


Test Case 4: User Redirection upon Successful Login

Objective: Validate that upon successful login, users are correctly redirected to the SDLMS dashboard.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Open the SDLMS application.

2.Enter valid username and password.

3.Click the "Login" button.

Expected Outcome: The user should be redirected to the dashboard screen, and the dashboard header should be displayed.


Challenges Faced:

1.Dynamic Content Loading: During testing, I encountered challenges related to dynamically loaded content, especially in scenarios where certain elements loaded asynchronously. I addressed this by implementing wait and expect functions to ensure element availability.

2.Error Message Localization: The SDLMS application provided error messages in multiple languages, making it crucial to handle localization for testing. I ensured that error messages were correctly displayed in various languages.

3.Responsive Design: Testing the SDLMS application on diverse screen sizes and devices presented challenges due to its responsive design. To address this, I conducted thorough cross-browser and cross-device testing to validate a consistent user experience.

Conclusion

This testing approach document outlines the strategy and procedures for thoroughly evaluating the SDLMS login process. It covers various scenarios, including both successful and unsuccessful login attempts, error message validation, and user redirection. This approach successfully addressed challenges related to dynamic content loading, localization, and responsive design, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the login process within the SDLMS application.
